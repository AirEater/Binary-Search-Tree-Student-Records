# Binary Search Tree - Student Records Management

## Project Description
This project is a **C++ console-based application** that manages **student records** using a **Binary Search Tree (BST)**. The system allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and deletion of student records based on their ID. It provides functionalities for searching students, managing student data dynamically, and loading/storing data using **file I/O operations**.

This project demonstrates **data structures (BST), recursion, dynamic memory management, and file handling in C++**.

## Key Features
✔ **Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation** – Efficiently organizes student records for fast lookup and management.  
✔ **Student Record Management** – Add, search, and delete student records dynamically.  
✔ **Tree Traversals** – Supports **in-order, pre-order, and post-order** traversal to display student records in sorted order.  
✔ **File I/O Support** – Reads student data from a file (`student.txt`) and saves records for future use.  
✔ **Find Deepest Nodes** – Identifies and prints the **deepest nodes** in the BST.  
✔ **Clone a Subtree** – Allows cloning of a **subtree of a specific student ID** into a new BST.  
✔ **Print Nodes by Level** – Displays students grouped by tree level.  
✔ **Print External Paths** – Outputs all external paths from the root to leaf nodes.  
✔ **Menu-Driven System** – Provides a **user-friendly menu** for selecting different operations.
